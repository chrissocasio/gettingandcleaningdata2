Getting and Cleaning Data - Assignment This repository hosts the R code and documentation files "Getting and Cleaning data". 
The dataset being used is: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones

Files The code takes original data which is un-compressed and without names altered. CodeBook.md or Codebook.rtf describes the variables, 
the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data. run_analysis.R contains all the code to 
perform the analyses described in 5 steps and the code has information listed to explain each step. Load this using Rprogramming or copy 
the code into a script file to view and run. 

The output of the 5th step is called Tidy.txt which will place the information in .txt file where you can read the information easily. 

NOTE: The codebook can be open using any type of computer (Mac, linux or Windows)  There are two file structures for the codebook because
some have stated that they've had issues reading the codebook in a .rtf file structure.  If you click on the .rtf codebook, hit the 
"Raw" button in github to view the information.  In the coursera course assignment, it does not state that the codebook has to be in 
a .md file.
